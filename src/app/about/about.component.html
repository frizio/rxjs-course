  <h3>Stream (of values)</h3>
  <p>
    Everything almost is asynchronous. We have requests coming from the network bringing new values from the backend,we have timeouts occurring in the frontend, we have user interaction with click mouse over events. All of those are asynchronous events that we need to combine in order to produce the final result of our program.
